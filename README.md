# hello-world
A repository is used to organize a single project.
A project can contain folders, files, images, videos, or anything your project needs.
README files is basically information about your project.

I made a new branch called readme-edits.
The readme-edits branch is basically a copy of the main branch.
Any edits that we make in the readme-edits branch will not affect the main branch.
So we can essentially have two different versions of the same project.

We use these branches (not main) to make edits before we commit them to the main branch.
When we are ready to make changes to the main branch, it is called merging.

Commit are the changes that we make on a project.
Each commit has a commit message, which is a description of the changed made.
Commit messages exists so that you and other contributors can understand what change was made and why.

At any point, we can always go and look back at past changes made in a project.
This is called version control.
This is helpful in case we ever want to go back to a previous version of a project, we can.
